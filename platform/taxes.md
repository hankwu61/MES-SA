# 營業稅

（針對 GitBook 購書流程中的稅項設定，只適用於美國市場）

請謹記下列資訊不是嚴謹的稅務建議，你應該完全遵照稅務法令申報。GitBook 會提供必要的稅務表單，但如果你有任何疑問，強烈建議您諮詢稅務專業人員。

### 應該提供給 GitBook 哪些資料？

填妥 [結帳設定](https://www.gitbook.com/settings/recipient) 中的各項資料。

### What tax documents should I expect from GitBook?

It depends on several factors, but here's a quick breakdown:
* Authors who sold at least 200 books and earn at least $20,000 in royalties earnings in the last year will receive a Form **1099-K**.
* Authors who earn at least $600 in earnings from royalties in the last year will receive a Form **1099-MISC**.
* Authors who do not meet either of the above criteria in the last year will not receive a tax form.

### How are the amounts on my 1099s calculated?

We know this can get a bit confusing, so let's break it down by form:
* **1099-K**: If you receive a 1099-K from us, the dollar amount you see in Box 1 consists of all earnings collected in the previous year (after we deduct our admin fee).
* **1099-MISC**: If you receive a 1099-MISC, the dollar amount in Box 3 is all income from GitBook royalties.

Remember: It's possible you won't receive either of these forms, so check out the above criteria.

### When will I be receiving my 1099?

We send out 1099s via USPS by the end of January. You will also receive this form by email in January. (Note: If you don't receive a 1099, it means you didn't meet the above thresholds and therefore won't be receiving one.)

### What if I didn't receive any 1099 forms?

In some cases, you may not receive a form at all. There are situations where authors won't receive a form, depending on amount earned, payout methods used, and the tax information submitted. If you didn't but were expecting one, please [send us an email](https://www.gitbook.com/contact) and we'll get it sorted out.

### Do I need GitBook's EIN for my tax return?

Since you are not an employee of GitBook, you are not required to provide GitBook's EIN (Employer Identification Number) on your tax return.
